Travelia is an innovative project that uses the OpenAI API to create a Tourist Guide BOT that is capable of bringing recommendations, indications and tips about any place in the world with a lot of creativity. Travelia is the perfect companion for those who love to travel and are looking for useful and reliable information to make their experience even more memorable.

With the help of OpenAI, Travelia becomes smarter and more efficient with every interaction with users.

All this in a creative and interactive way, making the user feel truly immersed in the local culture.

In addition, Travelia is easy to use and can be accessed from anywhere, whether on a computer or mobile phone. Just type the name of the place you want to visit and the BOT takes care of bringing all the necessary information to make the trip unforgettable.
